Sudoku Solver

Project Overview:

This project implements a Sudoku puzzle solver in Python using two different programming paradigms:
1- Functional Programming
2- Imperative Programming

The goal of implementing the solver using both paradigms is to:
- Understand the core differences between functional and imperative programming.
- Explore the strengths and weaknesses of each paradigm in solving computational problems.
- Develop a deeper appreciation for how different paradigms shape problem-solving approaches.

The solver can solve any standard 9×9 Sudoku puzzle, ensuring that each row, column, and 3×3 block contains the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once.
